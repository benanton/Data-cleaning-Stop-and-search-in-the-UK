# Data-cleaning-Stop-and-search-in-the-UK
This analysis focuses on the police stop and search figures provided by the UK Government at data.gov.uk. It's main aim is to understand the data available, and to clean it appropriately using the R programming language. Some analysis and visualization also takes place at the end!

To provide some background, a police officer has powers to stop and search you in the UK if they have ‘reasonable grounds’ to suspect you’re carrying illegal drugs, a weapon, stolen property or something which could be used to commit a crime. You can only be stopped and searched without reasonable grounds if it has been approved by a senior police officer. This can happen if it is suspected that: a) serious violence could take place b) you’re carrying a weapon or have used one c) you’re in a specific location or area. Being searched doesn’t mean you’re being arrested.

As part of the process, the police officers ask for a name and address, date of birth and self-defined ethnicity. One doesn't have to give this information if they don't want to; unless the police officer says they're reporting them for an offence.
